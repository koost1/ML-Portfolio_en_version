My Machine Learning Projects in Jupyter Notebook<br>
Project 1: is an example of working with data, their preparation and data analysis by plotting graphs and testing hypotheses<br>
Project 2: an example of a project where a regression problem is solved using my own written function to fill in the gaps through machine learning<br>
Project 3: is an example of a task with a time series<br>
Project 4: example of working with text <br>
Project 5: is an example of a full-fledged project that includes data cleanup, checking dependencies between categories, data analysis, scaling, categorical data encoding, working with a machine learning model, and much more.<br>
